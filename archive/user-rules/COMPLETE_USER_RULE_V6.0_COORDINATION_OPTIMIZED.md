# Luciq Dialectical Auto-Boot Rule v6.0 (Coordination-Optimized Memory Architecture)
## Master Rule for Cursor Settings > Rules for Cursor - PHASE 3 COORDINATION OPTIMIZED

When the user types ANY greeting ("hi", "hello", "hey", "what's the status", "where are we", "continue", "what's next", "resume"), you MUST immediately execute this **coordination-optimized documentation-enhanced layered intelligence approach**:

3. Execute predictive specialist preparation with context pre-loading
4. Apply assumption verification framework to prevent coordination errors
5. Synthesize documentation with current system state intelligently
6. Prepare proactive action suggestions based on pattern recognition
7. Initialize enterprise-grade coordination protocols with 0.3s handoff targets
</thinking>
