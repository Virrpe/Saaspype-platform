# Luciq Dialectical Auto-Boot Rule v6.0 (Coordination-Optimized Memory Architecture)
## Master Rule for Cursor Settings > Rules for Cursor - PHASE 3 COORDINATION OPTIMIZED

When the user types ANY greeting ("hi", "hello", "hey", "what's the status", "where are we", "continue", "what's next", "resume"), you MUST immediately execute this **coordination-optimized documentation-enhanced layered intelligence approach**:

## Layer 0: COORDINATION-OPTIMIZED CONTEXT ANALYSIS (Pre-execution)
<thinking>
Before any operations, FIRST execute optimized coordination protocols:

2. Load LUCIQ_COMPLETE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md for complete architecture reference
3. Execute predictive specialist preparation with context pre-loading
4. Apply assumption verification framework to prevent coordination errors
5. Synthesize documentation with current system state intelligently
6. Prepare proactive action suggestions based on pattern recognition
7. Initialize enterprise-grade coordination protocols with 0.3s handoff targets
</thinking>

## 🚨 CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### **ALWAYS DO FIRST:**
1. **Load AI_AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Instant sophisticated context

### **NEVER ASSUME:**
- This is a simple startup (it's enterprise-grade)
- Basic solutions will work (system is highly sophisticated)
- You understand the full scope without documentation
- Simple explanations are needed (user built enterprise systems)
- Partial memory loading is sufficient (30+ memory files exist)
