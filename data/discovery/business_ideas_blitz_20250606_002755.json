I'm trying to compile my 10+ years as a founder (both good and bad), mentor and MVP tester of over 40 Startups in the US, LATAM and EU area, and dumping everything into my website. \n\nMy idea is to provide weekly ebooks (self written, not prompted), share youtube videos that actually make sense, Book reviews that actually help (I guess we are all sick and tired of \"How to win friends and ...), as well as templates for structuring and scaling that I have either used myself or created with Founders along the way.  Maybe a newsletter as well, but I have no experience if those are even a thing anymore and I honestly don't want to create clutter and/or spam.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could give me feedback on that idea, the overall feel of the landing page and it's contents. I'm providing you with I think around 50 pages worth of information (1 Ebook free, 2 after sign up), tear it to shreds, tell me that I don't have a business case or that there is no need for it, whatever you say will help more than you think. \n\nThank you!

Almost around 40 units for each class. Along with pages templates for each subject.\n\nLong story short, the job duration was 3 months, they had a library of pre existing illustrations i had to puzzle to make the illustration needed, translate and do graphic design work, adapted to the branding style, i had to illustrate many things from scratch, google for hours for non AI generated copyright free images\u2026.\n\nIt was hell of project and they were happy I managed to finish on time, even before the deadline (rip my neck) and uploaded the files on their drive, as well as my communication with the teachers, creative coordinator was clear and on the point. They were happy.\n\nAlthough the payment was 2 months delayed due to International restrictions, i got payed eventually. \n\n2 weeks ago, I received a proposal for another project with another project manager within the same NGO. \nI had to ask him about the details and he said he needed a illustration consultant and he needs six illustrations over the four month period of the project . \n\nhe asked for my quote now my only mistake is I researched the project who\u2019s funding it, found its a generous grant. I quoted 1,600 USD flat fee.\n\nAnd since I\u2019m a consultant, not a freelancer typically I will have to start from conceptualizing from zero and with my fair judgement. Not given a task to do 1 2 3\n\nI emailed him a follow up email yesterday, and today he emailed me that they selected another candidate. They are still impressed with my work and they will keep coordinating for future project and blah blah blah blah.. \n\nI guess what is hurting less is they approached me, not i applied to them again. And my mistake ig is sending a flat fee rate without further asking for details about the illustrations themselves.

It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch. \n\nEverything was submitted. Everything was used.\n\nBut when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed \u2026 until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this \u2014 because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we\u2019re agreeable, fast, and \u201cteam players.\u201d\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries \u2014 suddenly we\u2019re \u201chard to work with.\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI\u2019m not sharing this for revenge.\nI\u2019m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We\u2019re expected to deliver premium work \u2014 and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We\u2019re supposed to be \u201cgrateful\u201d instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they\u2019re counting on. And it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m no longer offering.\n\nI\u2019m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same \u2014 you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for \u2014 or paid for. ",

CTA? structure?)\n\u2013 How to fix it using proven frameworks\n\u2013 What kind of uplift you might expect (based on real data)\n\nIt\u2019s designed for in-house CRM marketers or agency teams working with non-eCommerce B2C brands (like fintech, SaaS, etc), especially those using Klaviyo or similar ESPs.\n\nHow it works (3-minute flow):\n\n1. You answer 5\u20137 quick prompts:\n- What\u2019s the goal of this email? (e.g. fix onboarding email, improve newsletter)\n- Paste subject line + body + CTA\n- Add open/click/convert rates (optional and helps accuracy)\n\n2. The AI analyses your inputs:\n- Spots the weak points (e.g. \u201cCTA buried, no urgency\u201d)\n- Recommends a fix (e.g. \u201cReframe copy using PAS\u201d)\n- Forecasts the potential uplift (e.g. \u201c+\u00a3210/month\u201d)\n- Explains why that fix works (with evidence or examples)\n\n3. You can then request a second suggestion, or scan another campaign.\n\nIt takes &lt;5 mins per report.\n\n\u2705 Real example output (onboarding email with poor CTR):\n\nInput:\n- Subject: \u201cWelcome to smarter saving\u201d\n- CTR: 2.1%\n- Goal: Increase engagement in onboarding Step 2\n\nAI Output:\n\nFix Suggestion: Use PAS framework to restructure body:\n\u2013 Problem: \u201cSaving feels impossible when you\u2019re doing it alone.\u201d\n\u2013 Agitate: \u201cMost people only save \u00a350/month without a system.\u201d\n\u2013 Solution: \u201cOur auto-save tools help users save \u00a3250/month.\u201d\nCTA stays the same, but body builds more tension \u2192 solution\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Forecasted uplift: +\u00a3180\u2013\u00a3320/month\n\ud83d\udca1 Why this works: Based on historical CTR lift (15\u201325%) when emotion-based copy is layered over features in onboarding flows\n\nWhat I\u2019d love your input on:\n\n1. Would you (or your team) actually use something like this? Why or why not?\n\n2. Does the flow feel confusing or annoying based on what you\u2019ve seen?\n\n3. Does the fix output feel useful \u2014 or still too surface-level?\n\n4. What would make this actually trustworthy and usable to you?\n\n5. Is anything missing that you\u2019d expect from a tool like this?\n\nI\u2019d seriously appreciate any feedback and especially from people managing real email performance. I don\u2019t want to ship something that sounds good but gets ignored in practice.\n\nP.S. If you\u2019d be up for trying it and getting a custom report on one of your emails - just drop a DM.\n\nNot selling anything, just gathering smart feedback before pushing this out more widely.\n\nThanks in advance ",

That company by the way has always been wholly mine as its sole owner.\n\nNone of the brands or websites were ever listed as assets of the company. The company, my company, has essentially been paying for web hosting and domain registry, and benefit from advertising revenue. I am now in the process of dissolving that company and I am not doing any sale or transfer of assets because in my opinion, the company does not own any assets. 95% of its revenue came from my freelancing services, unrelated to the website I'm asking about.\n\nSomeone is now interested in possibly purchasing that website from me. And so that's why I am now, for the first time, asking this rhetorical question.. who owns my website? I think it's pretty clear cut that it's me personally, but I wanted to ask for a second opinion.\n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Studied 700 students who kept reflective journals for a year. The connection between \"deep reflection\" and better grades was weaker than expected, but those who wrote consistently seemed to understand their learning process better. It's not a magic bullet, but it's not useless either.\n\n**Why I looked into this**\n\nI've tried different types of journaling multiple times over the years - gratitude journals, morning pages, reflection prompts, etc.. Failed at doing this several times and thought: \"Is the problem in me?\".\n\nAfter my latest failed attempt, I got curious: is there actually any research about \"journaling helps with learning and self-improvement\", or am I just trying to be more organize? I decided to google some research and found this particularly interesting study with nearly 700 students that actually measured the effects, and thought it was worth sharing the findings here.\n\n**What the research found**\n\nScientists decided to test this properly with nearly 700 first-year students over an entire academic year (2007-2008). Students kept journals where they wrote about what they understood, what confused them, how they were learning, etc. Then they ran all that text through analysis software to measure the depth of reflection.\n\nResearch shows that students who keep reflective journals think about their learning in three main ways: critical analysis, learning strategies, and synthesizing what they've learned.\n\n**The results**\n\nThe connection between \"reflection depth\" and actual grades? Correlation analysis showed it was weak to moderate at best. Not exactly the dramatic improvement you'd expect from all the hype.\n\n**BUT** \\- and this is important - students who wrote thoughtfully and consistently seemed to develop better awareness of how they learn and what they actually understood. Reflective writing develops self-awareness and critical thinking, which matters beyond just grades.\n\n**Why the mixed results?**\n\nFew theories:\n\n* Most people don't really know how to reflect effectively (school teaches us to pass tests, not ask \"why don't I understand thermodynamics?\")\n* Students might have been writing just to check a box for their professor\n* Maybe reflection isn't about immediate grade improvement - it's about understanding yourself and how your mind works\n\n**My takeaway**\n\nReflective journaling helps, but it's not linear and definitely not magic. It's a tool, not a cheat code. Don't expect to wake up as a genius tomorrow, but you might become more aware of your own thinking patterns.\n\n**Should you try it?** If you can be honest with yourself (which is harder than it sounds), go for it. But that's not about instant effect. The benefit seems to be gradual self-awareness, not dramatic performance boosts. Actually this thought helps me to try journaling again.\n\n*Side note: One student wrote \"No man is an island\" in their journal, quoting John Donne's Meditation XVII from 1624. Sometimes students are deeper than we give them credit for. Or they just read good Instagram quotes.*",

      "selftext": "Hey all! \n\nI'm trying to be as genuine as possible in this sea of Karma farming, \"my project makes me 20k a month on accident\", and Chatgpt written posts. \n\nA few weeks ago, I posted on reddit to get feedback on my Startup consulting idea. It was pretty simple, for early to mid stage startups with the usual issues of scaling, defining and standardizing. Well, I got some pretty amazing input and decided to reshift a bit. \nI'm now somewhat proud to present the first s eak peak of my evolved idea: a Startup Resource Hub. \n\nInstead of browsing the Internet for countles hours, watching entrepreneurship videos, reading blog articles and subscribing to startup newsletters, I've build \"The Sneaker Ceo\". \n\nThe idea behind it is super basic. I'm trying to compile my 10+ years as a founder (both good and bad), mentor and MVP tester of over 40 Startups in the US, LATAM and EU area, and dumping everything into my website. \n\nMy idea is to provide weekly ebooks (self written, not prompted), share youtube videos that actually make sense, Book reviews that actually help (I guess we are all sick and tired of \"How to win friends and ...), as well as templates for structuring and scaling that I have either used myself or created with Founders along the way.  Maybe a newsletter as well, but I have no experience if those are even a thing anymore and I honestly don't want to create clutter and/or spam.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you could give me feedback on that idea, the overall feel of the landing page and it's contents. I'm providing you with I think around 50 pages worth of information (1 Ebook free, 2 after sign up), tear it to shreds, tell me that I don't have a business case or that there is no need for it, whatever you say will help more than you think. \n\nThank you!

For small businesses getting 300+ emails a week, this can save hours and reduce the need for a dedicated support agent, which can get pricey.\n2. **Chatbots That Actually Help**: A well-built chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) can handle 60-80% of customer queries. This boosts satisfaction by giving quick, accurate answers to common questions.\n3. **Intelligent Search for Better Conversions**: Use tools like Shopify\u2019s free Search &amp; Discovery app or invest in paid semantic search services. These make it easier for customers to find what they want, driving more sales.\n4. **Customer Analytics for Personalization**: Understand customer behavior to tailor their experience. This is why platforms like Facebook and Instagram are so good at selling through ads. They personalize feeds to keep you engaged. It\u2019s underused in e-commerce but powerful.\n5. **Streamlined Operations**: AI can optimize logistics, like finding the cheapest delivery options by comparing costs or figuring out how to pack items efficiently (e.g., stacking lawn chairs in a carton to maximize space).\n\nHope this sparks some ideas!
