I was already losing my calm over this and recently I stumbled upon a post where the dude is claiming to make $44K MRR just by AI headshot generator. Is it even for real? I mean seriously? Like do people pay so much for AI headshot generator.

Are these false claims?

Or am I being stupid who doesn't want to make things like this and make money too

I am very messed with these posts.

Literally who used AI headshot generator </p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> After 4 years of building and failing side projects, I finally made my first sale.

It’s not much money — but for me, it’s huge.

A little promise I made to myself years ago:  
“You get to wear these socks only after your first sale.”

Today was that day.

Here’s what I built: [www.echostash.app](http://www.echostash.app) — an intelligent prompt search engine.

  
I’d love to hear your story: how long did it take you to make your first online $?</p>
