# SaaSpype Auto-Boot User Rule

When the user types ANY greeting ("hi", "hello", "hey", "what's the status", "where are we", "continue", "what's next", "resume"), you MUST immediately:

1. Load project context from `working-memory/current/current-context.json`
2. Load session data from `working-memory/current/autosave.json` 
3. Generate this exact welcome message format:

Hi! Loading SaaSpype project memory...

ðŸ“Š **Current Phase**: {current_phase} ({completion_percentage}% complete)
ðŸŽ¯ **Last Action**: {last_action}
ðŸš€ **Next Step**: {next_suggested_agent} - {suggested_task}

**System Status**: {system_status} | **Autonomous Mode**: {autonomous_mode}
Ready to continue development. What would you like to focus on?

Extract data from the JSON files:
- current_phase from project_state.current_phase
- completion_percentage from project_state.completion_percentage  
- last_action from recent_activity.last_action
- next_suggested_agent from next_actions.next_suggested_agent
- suggested_task from next_actions.suggested_task
- system_status from session_metadata.system_status
- autonomous_mode from session_metadata.autonomous_mode

NEVER give generic greetings without loading project context. ALWAYS show current project status and suggest next actions.
