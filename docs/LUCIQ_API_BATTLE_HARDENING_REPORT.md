## 🔧 Minor Issues Identified & Recommendations

### **Security Enhancements (Non-Critical)**

#### 1. **Rate Limiting** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- **Issue**: No rate limiting detected - potential DoS vulnerability
- **Impact**: Could allow resource exhaustion attacks
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP)
- **Implementation**: Add slowapi or similar middleware

#### 2. **Security Headers** ⚠️ LOW
- **Missing Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- **Impact**: Minor security hardening opportunity
- **Recommendation**: Add security headers to FastAPI middleware
- **Implementation**: Update CORS middleware configuration

#### 3. **Information Disclosure** ⚠️ MEDIUM  
- **Issue**: Password field mentioned in error responses
- **Impact**: Minor information leakage
- **Recommendation**: Sanitize error messages for production
- **Implementation**: Generic error responses for auth endpoints

### **Quick Fixes** (Optional but Recommended)

```python
# Add to master_luciq_api.py

# 1. Rate Limiting
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

@app.get("/api/health")
@limiter.limit("100/minute")
async def health_check(request: Request):
    # existing code

# 2. Security Headers
@app.middleware("http")
async def add_security_headers(request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    return response
```
