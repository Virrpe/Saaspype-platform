## For New Claude Session in Cursor

> **Copy this entire prompt to start a new Claude session with complete context**

---

## üìã **IMMEDIATE CONTEXT**

You are taking over the **Luciq Master API Consolidation Project**. This is an enterprise-grade business intelligence platform with **219 Python files** that needs to be consolidated into a single unified API while preserving ALL functionality.

### **üö® CRITICAL BACKGROUND**
- **Luciq**: Revolutionary business intelligence platform with 15+ platform scraping, advanced AI, and real-time streaming
- **Current Status**: Phase 25 complete - system is fully functional with **18,000+ lines of sophisticated business logic**
- **Goal**: Consolidate into single Master API while preserving ALL customer-facing functionality
- **Architecture**: Clear separation between customer product and developer tools established

---

## üìä **PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED PREPARATION WORK**
1. **Complete Inventory**: All 219 Python files catalogued and analyzed
2. **Architectural Separation**: Clear distinction between customer product vs developer tools
3. **Dual-Track Strategy**: Two separate consolidation paths established
4. **Zero Logic Loss Plan**: Comprehensive audit ensures no functionality will be missed

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE TASK**
Execute the **Master API Consolidation** using the dual-track approach:
- **Track 1**: Luciq Master API (customer-facing business intelligence)
- **Track 2**: Developer Assistance System (agent coordination - stays separate)

---

## üìÅ **KEY FILES TO LOAD FIRST**

### **Essential Context Files** (Load these immediately):
1. `MASTER_API_CONSOLIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete inventory and preservation strategy
2. `DUAL_TRACK_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed analysis of both consolidation tracks
3. `LUCIQ_ARCHITECTURE_SEPARATION_PLAN.md` - Clear separation between dev tools and product
4. `python_files_inventory.txt` - Complete list of all 219 Python files
5. `working-memory/current/current-context.json` - Current project state
6. `AI_AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - System understanding and context

### **Core System Files** (For understanding scope):
- `src/api/domains/discovery/services/discovery_service.py` - Crown jewel (999+ lines)
- `scripts/production/mega_source_scraper.py` - 15+ platform scraper (695 lines)
- `src/api/domains/intelligence/services/multimodal_fusion_engine.py` - Revolutionary AI

---

## üéØ **CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY**

### **Track 1: Luciq Master API** (PRIMARY FOCUS)
**Include in consolidated API (~180 files)**:
```yaml
core_business_systems:
  - "src/api/domains/**/*" # 7 business domains (auth, chat, credibility, discovery, intelligence, streaming)
  - "scripts/production/**/*" # Mega scraping ecosystem (2,076+ lines)
  - "tools/analyzers/intelligence/**/*" # Business intelligence tools
  - "tools/nlp/**/*" # Advanced NLP engines
  - "tools/discovery/**/*" # Market discovery tools
  - "src/services/orchestration/**/*" # Business orchestration
  - "src/frontend/**/*" # Customer UI
  - Production deployment and monitoring systems
```

### **Track 2: Developer Tools** (KEEP SEPARATE)
**Exclude from customer API**:
```yaml
developer_assistance:
  - ".cursor/mdc/**/*" # Agent definitions
  - "working-memory/agents/**/*" # Agent coordination
  - "working-memory/current/agent-coordination.json" # Agent state
  - All boomerang/reflexion/handoff logic
  - Multi-agent coordination workflows
```

---

## üö® **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **MUST PRESERVE**:
- ‚úÖ **Market Discovery Engine** (999+ lines) - Crown jewel system
- ‚úÖ **15+ Platform Scraping** (mega_source_scraper.py + ecosystem)
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Intelligence Systems** (multimodal fusion, semantic analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Real-Time Streaming** (WebSocket infrastructure)
- ‚úÖ **All 7 Business Domains** (Complete API functionality)
- ‚úÖ **Sophisticated Business Logic** (18,000+ lines total)

### **MUST EXCLUDE**:
- ‚ùå Agent coordination systems (.cursor/mdc)
- ‚ùå Developer memory management (working-memory/agents)
- ‚ùå Boomerang/reflexion protocols
- ‚ùå Multi-specialist handoff logic

---

## üîÑ **SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS**

### **Phase 1: Context Loading**
1. Load all key files listed above
2. Review the complete consolidation strategy
3. Understand the dual-track separation approach

### **Phase 2: Master API Creation**
1. Create `master_luciq_api.py` with unified structure
2. Import all Track 1 business logic systematically
3. Preserve all revolutionary systems and advanced features
4. Ensure zero functionality loss

### **Phase 3: Validation**
1. Test consolidated API maintains all capabilities
2. Verify 15+ platform scraping works
3. Confirm advanced intelligence systems operational
4. Validate real-time streaming functionality

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Single Master API That Includes**:
- ‚úÖ Complete business intelligence platform
- ‚úÖ All 15+ platform scraping capabilities
- ‚úÖ Advanced AI and NLP systems
- ‚úÖ Real-time streaming and WebSocket infrastructure
- ‚úÖ All customer-facing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Production-ready deployment capability

### **Developer Tools Remain Separate**:
- üîß Agent coordination system intact in .cursor/mdc
- üîß Development workflow assistance preserved
- üîß No mixing with customer product

## üìû **HANDOFF MESSAGE**

**Start your response with**: "Taking over Luciq Master API Consolidation. Loading project context and consolidation strategy..."

**Then immediately**:
1. Load the key context files
2. Confirm understanding of dual-track approach
3. Begin systematic consolidation of Track 1 (customer API)
4. Preserve ALL sophisticated business logic while excluding developer tools

---

**READY TO CONSOLIDATE**: All preparation complete, clear strategy established, zero logic loss guaranteed.
