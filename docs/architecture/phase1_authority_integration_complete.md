## Technical Implementation

### Integration Architecture
```python
class ContextualSourceIntelligenceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Phase 1 Enhancement: Authority Analyzer Integration
        self.authority_analyzer = AuthorityAnalyzer()
        self.source_characteristics = self._initialize_enhanced_source_characteristics()
        
    def _initialize_enhanced_source_characteristics(self):
        # Enhanced with authority analysis
        enhanced_characteristics = self.authority_analyzer.enhance_source_characteristics(base_characteristics)
        
    def _calculate_antithesis_score(self, config, source_char):
        # Phase 1 Enhancement: Use authority-weighted quality
        if 'dialectical_quality' in source_char:
            base_quality = source_char['dialectical_quality']  # Authority-enhanced
        else:
            base_quality = source_char['base_quality']  # Fallback
```

### Dialectical Enhancement Process
1. **Base Quality**: Original engagement-based quality scores
2. **Authority Analysis**: Domain authority, trust scores, backlink quality, content depth
3. **Dialectical Synthesis**: 
   - **Thesis**: Authority metrics (domain authority weighting)
   - **Antithesis**: Engagement metrics (existing quality scores)
   - **Synthesis**: Balanced quality with tension resolution
4. **Enhanced Quality**: Authority-weighted dialectical quality scores

### Key Integration Points
- **Source Characteristics**: Enhanced with authority metrics and dialectical metadata
- **Quality Calculation**: `_calculate_antithesis_score` now uses authority-enhanced quality
- **Dialectical Metrics**: Full dialectical metadata preserved for analysis
- **Context Configurations**: Unchanged - existing contextual logic preserved
