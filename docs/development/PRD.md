# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

This gh0st-powered project provides AI-assisted development capabilities with:

- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based service architecture
- **Memory System**: Persistent AI context and session management
- **Agent Orchestration**: Claude-powered development assistance
- **Portable Deployment**: Self-contained project structure

## Core Features

### 1. AI Memory System
- Session persistence across development cycles
- Context preservation for continuous assistance
- Intelligent handoff between different AI specialists

### 2. Agent Coordination
- Master orchestrator for project coordination
- Specialized agents for backend, frontend, and deployment
- Seamless handoffs between different development phases

### 3. Portable Architecture
- Self-contained project structure
- Environment-agnostic deployment
- Minimal external dependencies

## Development Guidelines

1. **Memory-First Design**: All AI interactions should preserve context
2. **Agent Specialization**: Use appropriate agents for specific tasks
3. **Portable Patterns**: Maintain deployment flexibility
4. **Documentation**: Keep PRD and README updated

## Getting Started
