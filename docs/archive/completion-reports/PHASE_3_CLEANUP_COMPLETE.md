## 🧹 **PHASE 3 CLEANUP ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **✅ Directories Removed**
1. **`apps/`** - Contained old 1,092-line monolithic API
2. **`luciq/`** - Duplicate project structure
3. **`memory/`** - Old memory system (working-memory/ is active)
4. **`pages/`** - Duplicate of src/frontend/pages/

### **✅ Clean Directory Structure Achieved**
