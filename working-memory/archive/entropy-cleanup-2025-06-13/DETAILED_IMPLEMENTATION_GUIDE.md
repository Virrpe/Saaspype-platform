# Luciq Intelligence Revolution - Detailed Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **CONTEXT FOR NEW CLAUDE INSTANCES**

**Current Situation**: Luciq has a solid 4,206-line Master API operational on port 8000, but is missing 90% of the planned intelligence features documented in 40 JSON files in working memory.

**Strategic Decision**: "Build it solid" - quality over speed. Create revolutionary product competitors cannot replicate.

**Gap Analysis**: Working memory shows plans for $10B+ market disruptor with tiered pricing ($149/$349/$1299/month), but current implementation only has basic functionality.
