              "selftext": "# \n\nOk this is gonna sound like I'm oversimplifying but hear me out.\n\nI've been doing sales consulting for like 8+ years now and I swear, EVERY single company I work with has the same problem. Doesn't matter if they're selling software, professional services, manufacturing stuff, whatever.\n\nThey're all obsessed with getting more leads when they're literally bleeding money from the leads they already have.\n\nLike last year I'm working with this company and the CEO goes \"We need more traffic to our website. Our lead gen sucks.\"\n\nSo I'm like ok let me just peek at your current process first.\n\nTurns out:\n\nAverage response time to new leads: 23 hours (should be under 5 mins)They follow up twice then give up (most people need 7+ touchpoints)Proposals sit in email for weeks with no follow-up\n\nI'm like... dude. You don't need more leads. You need to stop throwing away the ones you have.\n\nWe fixed their response time and follow-up process. Nothing fancy. Just basic stuff.\n\nRevenue went up 34% in 3 months without spending a dime on new lead generation.\n\nThis happens EVERYWHERE. I've seen it 40+ times now.\n\nEveryone wants the shiny new marketing tactic but nobody wants to fix the boring stuff that actually makes money.\n\nHere's what I do now: Week 1: Figure out where leads are falling through cracks Week 2-3: Fix the biggest leak (usually response time or follow-up)Week 4: Measure what changed\n\nThat's it. Not sexy but it works every time.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: companies are sitting on 30-50% more revenue with their current leads. They just don't realize it because everyone's focused on the top of the funnel.\n\nIt's like having a bucket with holes in it and trying to fix the problem by pouring water faster.\n\nAnyone else seeing this? Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy because it's so obvious but apparently it's not obvious to the people actually running these companies lol\n\nWhat's the dumbest revenue leak you've found?\n\n  \nGuys i dont post this to promote myself,trying to provide value. Look at your business from this perspective and you will definitely find that leverage for growth ",

              "selftext": "After years of watching YouTube videos about startup / founder stuff and reading blogs, Reddit, and the horrible place that is LinkedIn, I came to realize that 99.9% of advice (especially in the SaaS world) is written / recorded by people who fake their success and their content IS their only real product.\n\nThere are a few exceptions, but mostly it's all fake.\n\nEven worse, startup advice has become an industry praying on the insecurities and vulnerability of first time founders. It is just as ridiculously bloated as the parenting literature, full of pseudo-sciency snakeoil sales men and women selling their \"system\", \"secrets\" and \"hard earned truths\".\n\nJust like the only parenting book you'll ever need is one page long (and it literally reads: \"if you want to be a good parent work on unconditional love and your patience.\"), the only startup book you'd ever need fits on a napkin. It would read:\n\n* validate your ideas w real users as soon as possible \n* always gather feedback from your users and build it in iteratively, shipping fast\n* don't think about scaling until you really need to, so use boring tech, boring GTM and just do the f\\*ing work instead of trying to optimize/game the system\n* selling and marketing IS the hard part not building\n* there's no shortcut or hacks just consistent work\n* hire your first 5 employees as if you were selecting your spouse and be just as good to them as you'd to your family\n* whatever you achieve, you got lucky so don't get cocky. Learn from it and try to replicate it in your next one.\n\nThat's it. That's all there is to it basically.\n\nBut obviously, just as with the parenting literature, no one can admit that otherwise there would be no best selling authors and YouTube channels with millions of subs. There would be no industry around the pornificaton of entrepreneur-secrets.\n\nThis brings me to my final point. If 99.9% who posts on Reddit and makes videos on YouTube are just actors selling you a dream, where are the truly successful entrepreneurs? They are sure as f\\*ck not posting on LinkedIn about their routine or system or whatever. And I'd bet my balls they are not here in the comment section either, dishing out advice. So where are they?\n\nWell, you guessed it. They are doing the work and running their companies.\n\nKinda make sense, doesn't it.\n\nDisclaimer: by my own definition I'm a nobody too that's why I'm here. But since I realized the above I spend way less time in the founder/saas/startup YouTube and blogosphere wasting my time. Hopefully it'll be useful to others just starting out, grinding through their first year or so.\n\n  \nFull disclosure bc someone asked this in the comments: we are working on automating the first point of the 7 above, check my profile or the comments if you're interested. (Hopefully it's clear I didn't post bc of this, it just came up in the discussion).",

              "selftext": "Growing a website is part of the entrepreneurial journey. I\u2019ve seen a huge amount of false information pertaining to link building/acquisition and how they interact with website growth, and how they force Google to perceive your site in different ways. The reality is that the largest online businesses you can think of invest heavily in link building, they all do it. But you can too - and there are things you can do to help your website and business get to the next level and compete for some hard to hit keywords.\u00a0\n\nHere are some strategies and tips I\u2019ve used for small, medium and large businesses to help them capture some commercial and high volume keywords - as well as general link building advice that can help Google look upon your site in a more favourable way. It\u2019ll either help you do a better job of it yourself, or hold the agency you use to a higher standard.\n\nThat\u2019s what link building is all about - doing something that shows Google that other sites trust you. If other sites (Good sites) trust you (sites that google already trust) then logically Google should trust you too, right? That\u2019s all it is but people get it so wrong when in reality its an incredibly logical (though time intensive) process. If you can convince Google to trust your website then you\u2019ll rank for more keywords, higher for currently ranked keywords, higher for more commercial keywords, and in general Google will send more of the right, relevant traffic your way.\n\n# Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity\n\nIf you want Google to trust your website more, and show it to more people searching for commercial terms relevant to what you\u2019re selling/offering - then logically it needs to trust the sites that link to you - that\u2019s what this is all about and what will help you rank higher. If google sees trusted websites linking to you - it\u2019ll raise your profile - but how can you evaluate whether google trusts a website?\n\nWeb traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here.\n\n* The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn\u2019t even operate in.\u00a0\n* The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources\n* The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed).\n\nSo - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they\u2019re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they\u2019re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday!\u00a0\n\nNumbers can be good if you\u2019re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you\u2019ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason).\u00a0\n\nA good agency/link builder will be able to build you a profile of beneficial and natural links while taking all this into account. Google needs to not only trust the site you want a link from, but to trust it for the right reasons.\n\n# Don\u2019t Just Settle For A Link\n\nThis is something I do for my clients and it's something you can do quite easily too.\u00a0\n\nWhen you approach a site and agree a price for a link placement, don\u2019t just leave it there. You can usually negotiate some extra elements that will give your link a bit more power (whether submitting content or using a link insert).\u00a0\n\nMake sure to ask the website owner to clarify:\n\n* If the cost includes the link being live for the lifetime of the site (some site owners may only leave it live for a specific amount of time - depending on the time, it could be worthless meaning you place the link elsewhere)\n* No other links to be inserted into your content (at least no other commercial or competitive links) once it's live\n* To request indexing in GSC manually\n* To internally link to the page from a few other pages - choose these yourself and make sure you choose pages that actually already rank\n* No affiliate links to be inserted into your content by site owner\n* Do they own any other website that they could use to link to the new content too\n\nThere are other things you could ask depending on the situation/website and your business - but those should ensure you extract more from your placement and better bang for your buck.\n\n# Don\u2019t Push Them All To The Same Place\n\nOne of the mistakes a lot of businesses (and indeed agencies) make with this is pushing all the links to the same place - usually this is the homepage.\u00a0\n\nHowever - Google rank pages! They don\u2019t rank websites (they rank websites on whole, but its the individual pages that google will rank, that\u2019s why, for example, some sites have certain pages ranked and indexed, while other pages aren\u2019t).\n\nPushing links to the homepage is a great idea when used as part of a wider strategy. That\u2019s to say for example if you\u2019re an accounting firm and you have a page dedicated to a business advisory service there\u2019s no point pushing links to the homepage for the business advisory service, these should go to the service page.\n\nHowever - on the other side of this, you can\u2019t send them ALL there (unless you\u2019re already ranking very strongly). You need to be diverse. In this case, you\u2019d send some to your homepage and some to the page you want to rank for the commercial term.\u00a0\n\nLinks to your homepage lead Google to trust your site as a whole - links to a direct service/product page leads Google to trust that page - it can be hard to have one without the other. Don\u2019t throw them all into the same page - mix it up. It works so much better, evenly, and the results will last long term. If you throw them all to the same page it looks unnatural - this is especially the case if the page was previously not ranking.\n\n# Contextualise The Content\n\nAlways place links in unique content that has been written for the website it\u2019s being placed on. You can then, in a nuanced way, contextualise the keyword (link placement) by talking about the industry or business type without being overly promotional. It sounds a bit technical, but it\u2019s really easy when you get the hang of it. Just remember:\n\n1. The contextualisation cannot occur in a promotional way\n2. The content has to be relevant for the website AND the link (80% website, 20% link)\n\nContext contextualisation is one of the most critical parts of link building. Links placed inside good, unique and relevant content will always do well, but if you can contextualise the content around the link it\u2019ll do much better and you\u2019ll get even more power from it. It\u2019s why curating the content is so important.\n\nIts something a lot of businesses, when building links for themselves, don\u2019t do right (and a load of agencies too) - you/they will end up creating links that look overly promotional or a bit stilted.\n\nTo gain googles trust, and to rank higher for keywords and pull more relevant traffic in, you need to make it appear that people are linking to you in an off hand and genuinely suggestive way.\n\n# Don\u2019t Go All In On Link Inserts\n\nThis one depends on the situation, as most - but there is still a troubling pattern emerging with link inserts in the wider business. Many businesses or link building/seo agencies use link inserts - where you insert the link into an existing bit of content/page rather than create new content and a new page. It can work well - but if not done right/well its completely ineffectual and won\u2019t help Google convey any trust upon your page/website.\n\nBest way to illustrate this is by looking at what I saw with a client and what they\u2019d been doing.\n\nFor this client, they\u2019d been using link inserts for a long period of time with mixed results. Every now and then they\u2019d get a small bump followed by a retraction. The strategy just wasn\u2019t working. One of the issues was that, as a large B2B machinery seller in the financial sector, the weak link inserts previously procured just weren't moving the needle for the more difficult keywords. Before we look at the strategy - I just wanted to run through link inserts in a bit more detail\u2026\n\nThey\u2019ve always been a cheaper option - and can sometimes be effective. However, there\u2019s a way to get the best out of them. A way that the majority of large \u201clink building agencies\u201d don\u2019t use or really care about due to the volume they\u2019re processing. Unfortunately, its led to misinformation in general about what works best for link inserts.\n\nI find the best way to look at them is in a kind of tier system. This is just something that's in my own head, but it might help you out. Remember, link inserts, in my opinion, rarely beat post placements because with a post, you can completely control the breadth of content that sits around the link, allowing you to get the best from it entirely. With a link insert, the content isn\u2019t primed to drive your link in the best possible way. Anyway:\n\nTier one: A link that's thrown into content that isn\u2019t even indexed on google.\n\nIn our opinion these are the lowest of the low (though some might think otherwise) - and usually what these agencies procure on mass for their clients (or other agencies outsourcing to them). Doesn\u2019t matter if the website is decent, if the page the link is in isn\u2019t indexed, it\u2019s going to do near nothing!\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re procuring a link insert yourself - check the content you want it inserted into is at least indexed on google! You can do this with a simple site:(webpage) search on google itself.\u00a0\n\nIn the case above, upon investigation, these were mainly the links procured for the client up until we started working together.\n\nTier two: A link in a page that\u2019s indexed\n\nIts better because its indexed. However, here you have to make sure the content is worthwhile, isn\u2019t terrible, and ties in with your own link.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t just want to throw your link into a page just because its indexed. Sure, you might be able to reword some of it, and potentially add in a paragraph that surrounds the link - but it has to be contextually relevant to what the link leads to.\u00a0\n\nThe client had a few of these too, some moderately relevant, but no consistency.\u00a0\n\nTier three: a link in content that ranks on google\n\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere. The content actually ranks on google - it isn\u2019t just indexed\u2026its ranked for terms. This means google is passing the content/page value\u2026its saying that essentially it trusts the page enough to show it to people. A link here is clearly more valuable than the above. Again - the content has to be on point, and you can\u2019t just throw your link into any content\u2026there has to be relevancy. With that said - a link in content that ranks, if done right, will usually pull.\n\nThe client had none of these\u2026\n\nTier four: A link in content that ranks for industry specific keywords\n\nThese are great, because the keywords are completely related to you, and to what you do. Difficult to get, but completely worthwhile.\n\nTier five: A link in content that ranks for what you\u2019re trying to rank for\n\nA holy grail - but usually out of reach. These work incredibly well usually - but most sites aren\u2019t going to link to a competitor from a page that ranks for a keyword they\u2019re trying to beat them in - but it can be done in certain niches and situations.\u00a0\n\nRemember - the content also has to be right when you\u2019re looking at link inserts, this is just illustrative of the different kinds out there without really looking at assessing the website or content - its a way of highlighting how you can leverage getting a good link insert out of your provider.\n\nMost bought are tier 1 - a good agency won\u2019t get you these kind of inserts (a great one will use inserts sparingly anyway - instead curating content that gives your link the best chance of doing well) - but this gives you an idea of how to leverage something out of it if buying them for yourself or assessing a provider.\n\nNow - back to the client, they sell large machinery with some pretty tough keywords to crack. The agencies previously primarily were using tier one and two above\u2026so no real efficacy, on pages with weak relevancy.\n\nBy pivoting to content curation, we were able to write for the target website while really making the most out of the link in the content we\u2019ve written. We focused down on websites in the B2B niche as well as websites within the niches that would use this kind of software - the link inserts previously were just slapped into any kind of weakly relevant content. Remember, with link inserts, the content has been written for another purpose (maybe even for another link) - so you\u2019re usually better off putting content together. The differentiation here got them where they wanted to be within 4 months, and when you think they\u2019d spent years building crappy link inserts it speaks volumes.\n\nThe main takeaway here is you can\u2019t cut corners. You either need to get GOOD link inserts, or curate the content yourselves and you\u2019ll see results if consistent. It boils down to logic. It also kind of shows how so many do this wrong (either due to lack of knowledge, or because they just can\u2019t be bothered to do it right).\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t just slap your links into any kind of content - Pivot to placing content written to support your link.\n\nMix Up The Keywords: But Don\u2019t Be Afraid To Go After The Harder Ones\n\n# Create A New Linkable Asset\n\nYou check the competition and make sure what you\u2019re trying to rank is better than what they\u2019re trying to rank\u2026it\u2019s the first thing you do. So, the content reads better, is longer (where needed, quality over quantity), page is faster etc\u2026sometimes that isn\u2019t enough.\n\nIn competitive niches you know your competitors will have top quality content that you can only match. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to think outside the box to make a dent, especially if you\u2019re new to the scene.\n\nIn this case, we created a calculator as a content break, then used links to rank the content that was built around the calculator. We made the content far more useful to the reader because it now included an interactive calculator. So, when we began the link building it worked a lot better and was more logical\u2026because bloggers, website owners etc. would logically link to the content that was better.\n\nSo, by creating a new linkable asset within the content we created a unique and specific angle.\n\nThis was predictably in the law/finance niche. The volume was very low but the difficulty was hard. The search intent was incredibly commercial and the kw led to clients that garnered eye watering payouts\u2026if that makes sense. Point being, they\u2019d previously ranked in the top three, and dropped to around 15. By adding links and the calculator, over four months they\u2019re now consistently fighting for 1.\n\nPoint being: have a look at the content breaks your competitors are using/not using and one up them with something unique. Then, when you go for a link building campaign you\u2019ll pull more traction. I\u2019ve seen this work elsewhere too but this is the most recent and applies to the \u201c2023\u201d moniker. It can be something as simple as some well placed infographics, unique pictures, data tables, etc. In our case, they\u2019d already been used by competitors so we had to get a dev to create a calculator. Just saying, it doesn\u2019t always have to be a calculator\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a trusted calculator, or a content break thats different from other competitors, you can create an angle of attack in harder industries that can help raise your sites profile once combined with links to said content break.\u00a0\n\n# Using An Agency? Find one that offers traffic and ranking increase - not just links.\u00a0\n\nThis should also apply to you if you\u2019re doing it yourself. Think and formulate a strategy that will garner ranking increase and more traffic - not a strategy that just blindly acquires links. The majority of agencies out there, if you buy a bunch of links or monthly services - will offer links of a certain DA/authority etc. That\u2019s it - that\u2019s their deliverable.\n\n\u00a0Finding an agency that doesn\u2019t look at that, but instead looks at increasing real and relevant traffic to your site and ranking you higher for chosen keywords is far better.\n\nRemember, links aren\u2019t there for the sake of it, they\u2019re built to increase traffic and ranking for your website. If a provider is saying X amount gets X links of X DA - that\u2019s done and finished. They\u2019ve secured you the DA 50 links you paid for, what happens next is up to chance! Find an agency with case studies who can create a link profile that actually makes a difference to your site, not just vanity metric inducing links that don\u2019t really do much at all. What\u2019s their strategy regarding site placements, keywords, link targets and how are they going to use this to grow your site. They can never guarantee it happening over a certain time, but if they know their stuff they\u2019ll be able to get their eventually - sometimes sooner rather than later.\n\n# Do Links Still Work?\n\nThey\u2019re an incredibly powerful ranking factor. There are other elements at play, as always, but if you get link creation right and you\u2019re consistent, and go at it with a planned and logical approach you can raise the profile of your website in the eyes of google and they\u2019ll send more of the right traffic your way = more sales/conversions. Its as simple as that.\u00a0\n\nGo at it with a targeted keyword strategy, decent budget and target the right kinds of links and you\u2019ll rank and compete for large keywords consistently. I\u2019ve seen it work time and time again, I\u2019ve seen smaller sites beat larger/more established ones - it just takes patience and the right approach.\n\nMost get it wrong because they don\u2019t do their research first before doing their own link building campaign, OR, they hire an agency that just slam links anywhere and don\u2019t put a proper plan together.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Had to repost this - the first time i posted from the old reddit and for some reason I couldn't reply to comments)",

No calls. Just me and a laptop trying to figure things out at 2am. You\u2019re wearing every hat sales, delivery, admin and still wondering if it\u2019s even working.\n\nFriends don\u2019t get it. Family means well but thinks you're just \u201cdoing something online.\u201d\n\nSome days you close a deal and feel invincible. Other days, it\u2019s dead quiet and you start questioning everything. That cycle is rough.\n\nI\u2019m curious if you're in the early stage or have been through it, how did you deal with this part?

              "selftext": "I started my company in 2023 after building a ton of solutions looking for problems.  I'm a software engineer who's always fucking loved writing code.  I can't stop.  I'm always building and if I'm not I'm depressed. I built a SaaS tool at the behest of my wife, a PHD chemist, to solve a real problem she was having.  \n\nThe thing is, just as I was starting to see success and the potential to pay myself from this side project we got pregnant.  I wasn't going to risk the future of my child on an (semi)unproven software idea. So I kept my day job and worked 60 hours a week (40 at the day job, 20 at the start up) to scale the business.  So many things hit at once though and it was an exceptionally stressful time towards the end.  \n\nFast forward another year and I have an 8 month old and 6 people working on this side-project-that's-gotten-out-of-hand. I was still working a day job and incredibly burnt out.  Again, not willing to risk my future on the business at this stage in my life, I started looking for a buyer.  I found 3, one via outreach on LinkedIn another via a networking event that happened a year prior, and another was a contact I knew.  I ultimately took the riskiest deal, so less cash up front but more upside potential and much more interesting work.\n\nAt the end of the day, I owned 85.5% of the company I sold and now have this sale as a feather in my cap.   I'm currently back to being a standard W-2 employee only, albeit a founding engineer at the company that acquired mine.  It's such a mixture of happiness, anxiety and, oddly enough, numbness to the sale.  I feel like I'm still working on awesome stuff, but fundamentally my life hasn't changed.  We'll have the house paid off, and the kids college fund paid for, but I'm still just a working stiff.",

I watched all these youtube videos, inspirational rich people and read all these guides, but literally nothing helped (business wise like growing the actual business)  \nWhat finally changed things wasn\u2019t some tool, funnel, or growth hack. It was just shutting up and listening.\n\nI started reading every post, comment, and question in forums where my potential customers usually engage. Not to sell, but to understand what's going on. I took notes on how people actually described their problems, frustrations and wins. Then I quietly rewrote my landing page, emails, and sales copy using their exact language that they used on the forums.\n\nThat shift doubled my conversion rate in about three weeks (almost tripled).\n\nNothing flashy. Just a change in approach. I even hit a pretty big win playing on Rolling Riches which gave me the opportunity to give myself a weekend off as a vacation and finally work on my messaging without pressure. Easily the best investment I\u2019ve made in my business so far.  \nWhat I've essentially learned from all this is that if you're stuck doing everything \u201cby the book\u201d and not seeing traction, maybe it's not effort that\u2019s the issue maybe it's the direction itself.\n\nGood luck!",
